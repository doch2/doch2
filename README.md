### Hi there 👋

Hello! I'm dohui Ryu, a developer and entrepreneur who strives to create a better world through IT technology.
I am currently majoring in web programming at Korea Digital Media High School.

By writing code, I want to turn my imagination into reality and become a person who presents dreams to people.<br/><br/>  

I first started coding through Minecraft. I have created Minecraft mode and plug-in, and I have produced a number of Minecraft contents by creator YangDding(양띵).

Currently, I am developing a service that solves people's inconvenience using flutter.  
As a representative service, there is 'Harang, a coding education service based on Hangul programming language'.  
In addition, I have experience in researching artificial intelligence and writing artificial intelligence papers on topics related to stock price prediction.

You can find out more about my projects through my portfolio site!
