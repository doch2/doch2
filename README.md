### Hi there 👋

Hello! I'm Dohui Ryu, a developer and entrepreneur who strives to create a better world through IT technology.
Currently, I am attending the Department of Web Programming at Korea Digital Media High School and serving as the CEO of [HORANG EDU Corp.](https://horang.it).

I want to write code and turn my imagination into reality and become a person who presents dreams to people.<br/><br/>  

Currently, I am producing services that solve people's inconveniences through various technologies.
Currently, the most focused service is 'Coding Education Service Using Hangul Programming Language, "Horang"'.  
I am striving to start a company and grow services by being selected as a support project for prospective entrepreneurs by the Ministry of SMEs and Startups Korea in 2023 (average support fund of $38,500).  

I'm producing a "KOSMOS" service that solves crowd turbulence, which is the cause of "crowd crush" such as the Itaewon disaster. 
Through this, I was selected as the Korean delegation to the 2023 European Union Contest for Young Scientists (EUCYS) International Science Competition hosted by the European Commission.

In addition, I have devised various types of social venture products such as "Sinibank," a banking service for the elderly, and "FlowerStick," a digital education service.  
It also led the production of "Dimipay", a face-certification card payment solution used in the school, and "Dalgeurak", a simple meal service.
It was also selected as the 2022 Talent Award of Korea🏅 through various activities.

In addition, I have experience in researching artificial intelligence and writing artificial intelligence papers on topics related to stock price prediction.
