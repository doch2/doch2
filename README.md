### Hi there 👋

Hello! I'm **Dohui Ryu**, a developer-entrepreneur working to build a better world through IT.  
I write code to turn imagination into reality and give people the gift of possibility.

In 2023 I founded and now run **[HORANG EDU Corp.](https://horang.it)**.


---

What I’m building—

Right now I’m creating **“Horang,”** a service that teaches coding *in Korean* so children who struggle with English-based languages can learn to program with ease. My goal is a world where anyone can swiftly develop computational thinking and build the software they envision, while also giving teachers tools that remove everyday pain points.

What we’ve achieved so far—

* Completed multiple Korean government startup programs, including **Youth Startup Academy**, and raised investment from the Yoonmin Foundation.
* Researching and developing classroom-friendly features such as an AI Coding Tutor powered by RAG techniques.
* **45 +** schools and learning centers already use Horang, both free and paid.

Other projects & recognition—

* Built **“KOSMOS,”** a service that mitigates crowd turbulence—the root cause of crush disasters like the Itaewon tragedy—and was selected for the Korean delegation to **EUCYS 2023** (European Union Contest for Young Scientists).
* Ideated social-venture products such as **“Seni(or)Bank,”** a banking service for older adults, and **“Kkotpang-i,”** a digital education platform.
* Led campus projects including **“DimiPay,”** a facial-recognition cafeteria payment system, and **“Dalgeurak,”** a convenient meal-kit service.
* Honored with the **2022 Korea Talent Award🏅**, presented by the Deputy Prime Minister of South Korea.

I’ll keep writing code that transforms imagination into reality—so more people can dream, build, and thrive.


In addition, I have experience in researching artificial intelligence and writing artificial intelligence papers on topics related to stock price prediction.
